# Password-Generator

## Introduction
Our task for this assignment was to create a browser-based web application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. The Password-Generator will run in the browser and my JavaScript code will enable dynamically updated HTML and CSS. The app will be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes and will also feature a clean and polished user interface.
